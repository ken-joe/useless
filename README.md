# USELESS WEB


## Basic Details
### Team Name: ERROR 404


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Ken Joe Augustine - AISAT
- Member 2: Aswin Sreekumar - AISAT


### Project Description
Useless Web is a parody website filled with intentionally pointless and mildly annoying interactions. It's a playful take on bad UX and absurd design, made purely to confuse, irritate, and amuse.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are far too productive and sane while browsing the internet. There’s a dire lack of websites that waste time, fry brain cells, and test human patience for absolutely no reason. We're here to fix that.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a glorious collection of digital nonsense — from infinite CAPTCHAs to fake logins and demotivational wisdom — all carefully designed to irritate, confuse, and entertain. It’s the internet equivalent of poking your brain with a stick, just because we can.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
-  None (vanilla everything for maximum chaos)
- None (we handcrafted the absurdity ourselves)]
- VS Code, ChatGPT, Proplexity

This is the main interface of Useless Web. Each tile represents a completely pointless mini-project — some with toggle switches, others with chaotic effects waiting to be triggered. It's neat now… but it won't stay that way for long.

A closer look at one of the mini-projects: Cat Facts Overload. Once toggled on, the screen fills with random, weird cat facts. It doesn’t stop until you turn it off. Why? No reason — that's the whole point.

Here's what happens when you turn everything on. Fonts keep swapping, colors go wild, icons spin and wobble, text is reversed, and cat facts pop up everywhere. It's digital mayhem — exactly as intended.


## Team Contributions
- Ken Joe: Contributed to brainstorming and feature ideation, built core JavaScript functionalities, styled the UI components, and helped design the interactive behavior of each mini-project.
- Aswin Sreekumar: Co-led brainstorming sessions, implemented interactive effects and animations, refined UI layout and responsiveness, and assisted in testing and debugging across all features.
